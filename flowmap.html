			<p class-"card-text">Places that receive the most flows are located along the shoreline of 
Lake Michigan. This is likely because of the reliance that tourists who 
tend to visit the lake and attractions (e.g., Shedd Aquarium, Field 
Museum) along the lake have on temporary modes of transportation; 
people may drop off bikes here after exploring a segment of the 
lakefront and/or before entering an attraction building. Meanwhile,
places that send the most flows are more inland. This may be where a 
concentration of parking garages or bus stations might be, 
necessitating a change in transportation mode.</p>

<p class-"card-text">Instead of places that attract or send more flows than others, we see 
that stations tend to both send and receive bikes from the same 
station or small grouping of stations relatively equally. For example, 
Station A might send 100 bikes to Station B and receive 100 bikes from 
Station B. Some of these “paired” stations are located very close to 
one another and others are quite far away, but we consistently see 
this positive relationship between bikes sent and bikes received.
As was mentioned before, stations tend to “trade” bikes with the 
same station or cluster of stations. In general, we see these trades 
occurring in the north-south direction, which makes sense as the 
Divvy bike stations are concentrated in a north-south line down the 
coast of Lake Michigan. Further, people tend to primarily explore
Chicago along the lake due to the concentration of entertainment, 
restaurants, and businesses, accounting for the north-south spatial 
pattern.</p>

<p class-"card-text">We see the highest flow values over shorter distances and usually 
between Chicago “staples,” such as Soldier Field. It is probable that 
Divvy constructed more nodes, or stations, where their (mainly) 
tourist audience would be likely to use them. This audience would 
likely not use the bikes for a long distance, as they are sightseeing
rather than commuting (and regular commuters likely have their own 
bikes to save money), which is why high flow values are seen between 
close-together stations. There is a pair of stations (one near the top of 
the map and one near the middle) that send and receive bikes over a 
long distance, which is not commonly seen in this map. This may be 
an outlier representing a trip between two relatively popular and 
related locations. The terrain basemap chosen alongside a general 
knowledge of Chicago’s layout allows users to understand where 
nodes are located and why certain nodes import or export a certain 
number of bikes.</p>
